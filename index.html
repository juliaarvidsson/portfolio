<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<h5>
  I am a driven and focused individual who is passionate about leadership, business development and technology. Businesses are increasingly looking towards technology as a driver of revenue and this relationship is truly fascinating to me. That is also why I joined Cisco - to be in the centre of technology, business and innovation.<br><br>

  Currently in my second year at Cisco, I am working as an account manager within a global organization that is focusing on the Service Provider market.<br><br>

  Hobbies and interests include languages and travelling (I speak four languages fluently and I have worked or studied in four different countries) as well as food, ice skating, technology and computer games. I have also recently started to learn the basics of programming as a hobby. This website is a result of this hobby, as it is coded and published my myself.
